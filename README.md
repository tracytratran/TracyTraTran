My journey into tech started with curiosity and a JavaScript tutorial.

While I’m still early in my development career, I'm committed to expanding my skills and building accessible, user-friendly applications. I’m both solution-oriented and detail-obsessed (in a good way 🔍), and I thrive on feedback that helps me improve.

Before tech, I was a dedicated administration officer, with solid soft skills like communication, collaboration, and staying calm under pressure, which I now bring into tech life.

Outside of coding, you’ll probably find me doing yoga and pilates, or meditating like it’s a full-time job (mindfulness practitioner in progress 🧘‍♀️). Also, I’m a proud cat enthusiast, the internet and I have that in common.
